// routes/formRoutes.js
// Authenticated Forms management routes (Phase 1b). Mounted at /api so both /api/forms/* and
// /api/duplicate-reviews/* resolve from this one router — DuplicateReview is deliberately not
// Forms-specific in its data shape (FORMS_DOMAIN_MODEL.md §3 / D6 shared-engine decision), so its
// routes live at their own top-level path, not nested under /forms.
//
// Middleware stack matches every other authenticated module exactly: requireAuth -> subscriptionGate
// -> restrictByPlan("forms", "read"|"write") -> checkPermission("forms", "readonly"|"read-write").
