// jobs/salesSubscriptionBillingJob.js
//
// The recurring half of the Sales Subscription module. A SalesSubscription is
// not an invoice — it is the standing instruction "bill this customer this
// document every N <unit>". This job is what turns that instruction into
// actual Invoices:
//
//   SUB-0001 (Active, every 1 month, next 01 Sep)
//        |  01 Sep arrives
//        +--> INV-001   -> Payment
//        |  01 Oct arrives
//        +--> INV-002   -> Payment
//        ...
//
// It deliberately contains NO billing math of its own. Every invoice is built
// by salesSubscriptionController.generateInvoiceForSubscription — the exact
// same function the manual "Generate Invoice Now" row action calls — so the
// automatic and manual paths can never drift apart. This file only decides
// WHICH subscriptions are due and WHEN to look.
//
// Status contract this job honours (and is the only thing that enforces it):
//   Draft     - created, billing not started -> never touched here. The user
//               starts it by setting it Active (or by generating manually,
//               which flips it Active itself).
//   Active    - the only status billed on schedule.
//   Expired   - endDate passed and nothing is left to generate -> stops.
//   Cancelled - stopped by the user, terminal -> never resumed, and already
//               has nextInvoiceDate cleared by the controller.
//   Error     - the last generation attempt failed (lastError holds why).
//               Skipped until a human puts it back to Active, so a broken
//               subscription can't spam failures every hour.
//
// Already-generated invoices and their payments are never touched by any
// branch here — expiring or erroring a subscription only stops FUTURE
// generation, which is what keeps the accounting history intact.
//
// Schedule: hourly at :05, matching renewalLifecycleJobs.js's hourly cadence.
// Billing dates have day granularity, so minute-level ticking would only mean
// 60x the queries for zero benefit.
//
// Locking: a module-level in-process boolean, the same assumption every other
// job in this codebase makes (single Node process, no distributed lock
// primitive exists here). This does not protect against overlap across
// multiple server instances — flagged, not fixed, consistent with
// renewalLifecycleJobs.js.
//
// Mount once in server.js: require('./jobs/salesSubscriptionBillingJob');
