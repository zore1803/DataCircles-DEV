// Links one Payment to one settled document (Invoice or Purchase) for a given
// amount. A single payment can carry several of these — that's the "split a
// ₹10k receipt across two invoices" case — and the amounts need not add up to
// the payment total: whatever is left over stays as an unallocated credit
// balance on the Payment itself (Payment.allocatedAmount vs Payment.amount).
//
// The allocation does NOT replace the document's own `payments[]` subdocument.
// Allocating also pushes a subdoc onto the Invoice/Purchase, and
// `documentPaymentId` points at it, so every existing Paid/Pending screen
// (getCompanyInvoiceSummary, the invoice list, the purchase status badge)
// picks the allocation up through the exact math it already runs, with no
// changes. This record is what makes that push reversible and auditable.
