/*
 * Expenses and Indirect Income.
 *
 * One model, two `kind`s. The two records carry the same fields (amount, date,
 * category, notes, payment state) and differ only in direction and wording, so
 * splitting them into separate collections would duplicate every query,
 * controller and index for no gain. `kind` keeps them apart everywhere it
 * matters, and each has its own category list.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a Payment: these are standalone ledger entries with no
 * counterparty document to settle, so they don't go through the allocation
 * engine. They do surface in the payments timeline as cash movements.
 *
 * The vendor link is OPTIONAL and off by default ("Create with vendor" in the
 * form). Most day-to-day spending has no counterparty worth recording, and
 * those entries fall back to their category wherever a party is shown. When a
 * vendor IS set the entry still stays a standalone ledger row — it does not
 * become a Payment and never enters the allocation engine, so it can't settle
 * a purchase bill. It simply attributes the spend.
