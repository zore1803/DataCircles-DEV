//
// Renewal Engine — Phase 4B Slice 1 ("Renewal Happy Path v1"), per
// IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md's Phase 4B design subsection and
// BILLING_DOMAIN_SPECIFICATION.md Chapter 3.5 (R1-R13).
//
// SCOPE OF THIS SLICE, DELIBERATELY NARROW: one subscription, zero PENDING
// ScheduledChange records, valid mandate, successful charge. This is not the
// full Renewal Engine — it is the happy path only. NOT wired into any cron,
// scheduler, or webhook. Not called from anywhere yet — callable, not running.
//
// PHASE 4B SLICE 3 — all four outcomes (RENEWED/PAST_DUE/RECONCILIATION_NEEDED/
// SKIPPED) are now structured returns, never throws, for expected business
// cases. PAST_DUE is fully real: a clean charge failure sets appStatus to
// past_due (via the existing setAppStatus helper) and leaves BillingInvoice/
// CommercialTransaction untouched in their non-terminal state, so a Retry
// Engine calling renewSubscription() again finds them and resumes via the
// same R13.5 repair-forward logic already verified in Slice 2 — no new
// idempotency work was needed for this. RECONCILIATION_NEEDED is a structured
// return now too, but its actual reconciliation logic (querying Razorpay to
// find out what really happened) is still not built — only the throw-vs-return
// shape changed, per Phase 4C's Step 7 finding that this was the actual
// blocker, not new idempotency work.
//
// Explicitly still NOT built:
//   - ScheduledChange application is now real (Phase 4E) — R3 queries
//     PENDING ScheduledChange records with effectiveAt <= now and folds
//     them into the Effective Subscription via buildEffectiveSubscription().
//     A due CANCELLATION short-circuits into its own CANCELLED outcome
//     before any pricing/charge step. REDUCE_QUANTITY has no real-world
//     writer yet and throws rather than guessing its shape.
//   - Real reconciliation logic behind RECONCILIATION_NEEDED (Razorpay query).
//   - The Retry Engine itself, and whether `retrying` is a real appStatus
//     value or derived shorthand over `past_due` — an open question named in
//     the Phase 4C design subsection, not resolved here.
//
// R7 — Coupon revalidation at renewal (§3.6a, Chapter 19 C2/C4, Chapter 17).
// utils/couponRenewalEligibility.js gates the coupon modifier on
// `appliedCoupon.duration.type`. Only `lifetime`/`until_cancelled`/
// `first_payment` are handled — verified by tracing the actual creation
// validation (couponController.js's ENFORCEABLE_DURATIONS) that these are
// the only reachable-in-production types today (`fixed_cycles`/`until_date`
// are rejected at coupon creation). `fixed_cycles` (needs a cycles-consumed
// counter — confirmed by grep, none exists anywhere) and `until_date` (needs
// an expiry field on the SNAPSHOT itself, which also doesn't exist — the
// live Coupon.validity.expiryDate must never be read here per this file's
// own snapshot-immutability rule) are both explicitly NOT implemented,
// fail-closed, same 🟩 triage class as this session's other
// declared-but-unbacked-state findings. Not a live bug either way: both
// types are unreachable in production today.
//
// R8 — Referral reward as a renewal-time modifier (§3.6b, RF1/RF3/RF6). Wired
// in below, reusing the exact same reservation/consumption primitives already
// proven live at the upgrade and add-on/seat-purchase call sites — no new
// business logic, no new schema:
//   - Reservation happens once, in the fresh-renewal branch only (never on a
//     resumed attempt — see the `rewardUsageId` handling in both branches
//     below), mirroring startAddonPurchase()'s reservation step.
//   - The reserved RewardUsage's id is stored in
//     CommercialTransaction.target.rewardUsageId (same pattern already used
//     for orderId/period dates) so a resumed run (R13.5) recovers it without
//     re-reserving.
//   - Consumption happens inside this function's own commit sequence, right
//     after the charge is recorded COMMITTED — NOT in a webhook handler, since
//     unlike an Order-based purchase, renewal's charge result is known
//     synchronously here. consumeReservation() is already a status-guarded
//     atomic update (verified safe against duplicate calls in this project's
//     reservation-lifecycle audit), so calling it again on a resumed renewal
//     is safe by construction — no extra guard needed at this call site.
//   - PAST_DUE (clean charge failure): the reservation is deliberately left
//     `reserved`, not released — same "leave it, let the resumed/retried
//     attempt reuse it" philosophy R13.5 already applies to
//     BillingInvoice/CommercialTransaction. A purchase-flow reservation
//     releases on outright decline because there's no repair-forward retry
//     for that flow; renewal has one, so releasing here would let a
//     concurrent, unrelated reservation attempt steal the reward out from
//     under a retry that's about to succeed.
//   - RECONCILIATION_NEEDED (ambiguous charge result): same reasoning — left
//     untouched, exactly like BillingInvoice/CommercialTransaction are.
//   - The VOID-and-replace interaction (RF6 — a concurrent commercial action,
//     e.g. an upgrade, voids this renewal's pending invoice before payment
//     resolves) is NOT handled inside this file — it lives wherever that
//     void-and-replace logic runs (see the RENEWAL-type addition next to
//     subscriptionController.js's existing UPGRADE VOID-on-recycle block).
//
// CAW-only. Legacy (non-CAW, Razorpay-Subscription-driven) renewal is
// completely untouched — those subscriptions keep renewing via
// handleSubscriptionCharged/Razorpay's own webhooks, unrelated to this file.

 * @param {Object} subscription - a Subscription document, already confirmed:

 *   This function does NOT itself perform R1/R2's due/renewable checks —
 *   those are the caller's job. It DOES perform its own ScheduledChange
 *   query (R3) — see buildEffectiveSubscription().
 * @param {Function} chargeMandateFn - injected CAW charge call, real signature
 *   TBD by whichever session wires actual Razorpay charging; must resolve to
 *   { success: true, paymentId, orderId } or throw. Injected so this slice's
 *   own tests can stub it without touching real Razorpay.
 * @returns {Promise<RenewalResult>}
 *
 * PHASE 4B SLICE 2 — R13.5 idempotent repair-forward. Every step below checks
 * "did this already happen?" against existing persisted state before acting,
 * same philosophy as reconcileMandate (subscriptionController.js:1880) — not
 * a Mongo transaction (the charge is an external, non-reversible side effect;
 * no local transaction can roll it back), and not a new orchestrator. Calling
 * this function twice for the same subscription+period, at any point after a
 * partial failure, resumes from the first incomplete step instead of
 * re-running completed ones — the mandate is charged at most once per period.
 * @param {String} [_injectFailureAfter] - TEST ONLY, undefined in all production
 *   call sites. Throws immediately after the named checkpoint's write
 *   succeeds, so Step 6's verification scenarios can prove repair-forward
 *   resumes correctly. One of 'CHARGE_COMMITTED' | 'INVOICE_PAID' |
 *   'SUBSCRIPTION_ADVANCED'. No effect on any real code path when omitted.
